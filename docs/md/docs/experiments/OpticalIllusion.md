# Optical illusion experiment

This is an excercise to experiment with optical ilussion.

## Kanizsa Triangle

The Kanizsa triangle is an example for modal completion. Illusory contours forming a triangle in the absence of corresponding luminance contrast changes. The interior of the triangle generally appears brighter than the ground, even though it is not.
